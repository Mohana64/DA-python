1. upload the file in jupyter notebook
2. import the libraries ,such as pandas,numpy,
   seborn etc... whatever is required
3. After importing all the required libraries,
   explore the dataset , columns and rows with
   functions like .info() and .describe()
4. First thing after all the exploration is 
   checking for the null values  
5. using the inbuild function we can find if   
   there is any null values present in the 
    dataset are not (isnulll().sum())
6. This dataset doesn't have a null values if
   there is any null value we should fill
   or delete the null values according to the dataset usage
7. found the unique country names and the count of those country
8. choose a single country from the dataset and plot that particular country's Gdp value
9. calculated the gdp values with the formula and added that particular column to the dataset for the analysis
10.To analysis more country at the same time 
used a list with a country code and created a function and whenever we call that function  the gpd of that particular country will be plot and that was automated through code
11. passed the parameter through list because there are multiple country code , since it will take only one parameter as [] and inside the list passed two are more values
